The Jolt.NET projects Jolt.Automata.Msagl and Jolt.Automata.Msagl.Test require Microsoft AGL (MSAGL) assemblies for compilation and execution.  Due to the nature of the MSAGL license, MSAGL can not be distributed with Jolt.NET.  Consequently, you must obtain MSAGL and place any its binaries in this directory for successful compilation.
